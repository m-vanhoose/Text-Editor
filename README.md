# Text-Editor

This text editor app is intended to be a quick and easy note taking app. It allows a user to type information that is automatically saved for later use. 

You can view the app at https://editor-pwa.herokuapp.com/ where it is possible to download the app to your local device for ease of access.

I recieved help building this app from my tutors Mansi Patel and Jili Jiang as well as my instructors Slavic Andreev and Stephon Autery for some major bug fixes.
